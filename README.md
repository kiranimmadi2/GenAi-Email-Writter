# ðŸ“§ Cold Mail Generator

A cold email generator built using **groq**, **langchain**, and **streamlit**. It allows users to input the URL of a company's careers page. The tool then extracts job listings from that page and generates personalized cold emails. These emails include relevant portfolio links sourced from a vector database, tailored to the specific job descriptions.
